# Network Creation
This project is about my ability to build a Simple Network & Configure the endpoint devices and verify connectivity to the internet Utilizing dynamic host communication protocol (DHCP), network subnet mask and IP config to validate IP addresses.


I was able to design and configure a basic home network comprised of two endpoints or clients in the form of a personal computer and a laptop, the picture below displays the basic network topology from a logical view. The logical network topology also displays a wireless router and a modem which connects to the Internet and the desired server.

Utilizing the network ip config command helped me to learn the subnet mask, the IP address and the Mac address of the device utilizing the command line interface.

Utilizing my knowledge of troubleshooting networks I was able to utilize the ping command . To validate and verify connection

While configuring a personal computer for a wireless network use I was able to validate that the PC was connected to the desired home network and that the PC was being able to communicate with the wireless router and able to send data out to the Internet.
